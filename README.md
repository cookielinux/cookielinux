Jokes aside, Linux is pretty cool. But not cool enough for the desktop. It's choppy, confusing, and ultimately stupid. Boot up Debian and tell me it's friendly. The only thing keeping linux from being turned into a horror movie is the jokes. (examples: "Bailing out. Your on your own, good luck!" and "We are hanging here")

## So what the actual frick is this?
I don't have any idea either. All I know is that it's a linux distro. So no more questions

## Software
I'm not much of a hardware guy, so i'm not gonna create a computer and sell it anytime soon. But that's another reason I am doing this.
<br>Anyways, here's the list

### Main stuff

GNOME w/Aylur's Widgets, Blur My Shell, Dash to Dock
<br>
Neofetch (to make post-install faster if you want a screenshot)
<br>
Plymouth
<br>
AMD/Intel Microcode
<br>
APT

### Tools n' stuff
GNU Coreutils *or* BusyBox (late 2022/Early 2023 maybe in the BETA channel)
<br>
CMake
<br>
systemd
<br>
xkill
<br>
BASH

## So what's it based on?
Debian. How have you not found that out by now?
